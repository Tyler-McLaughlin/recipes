    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This sesame chicken is crispy chicken pieces tossed in a sweet and savory
      honey sesame sauce. This version is even better than what you would get at
      a restaurant!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
        <em><strong>cut into 1 inch pieces</strong></em>

      <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the eggs, salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir to combine</li>
      <li>
        Place the flour and 1/2 cup of cornstarch in a shallow bowl or on a
        plate. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into the flour.
        Repeat the process with all of the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Heat 3 inches of oil in a deep pan to 250 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Add 7-8 pieces of chicken to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes or until crispy
        and golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the chicken on paper towels.</li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooking, combine the honey, soy sauce, ketchup,
        brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the teaspoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic
        and cook for 30 seconds. Add the honey sauce mixture and bring to a
        simmer. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until just thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crispy chicken to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce.
        Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions, then serve.
